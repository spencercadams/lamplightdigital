    heading: Our values
    text: The name LampLight came from how we work.  There are a lot of analogies we could pull about lamps.  An onset to new technology and innovation, burning the midnight oil, shining a light into the future, etc.  I'd say each have their place and are part and parcel to our work.  Ultimately, the name came from a Lamp named Sam in my office.  Regardless of "Sam," we will do everything in our power to deliver results.
