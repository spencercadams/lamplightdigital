      Design is phase one.  We listen more than we speak and understand your goals and objectives.  We then discuss and collaborate using DevOps tools about next steps.  We whiteboard.  We markup/markdown.  We develop an Architecture or Topology to fit your needs.

      Implementation is unique for LampLight.  Since we have a small team, we only take on implementation projects within our scope.  We are happy to evaluate your needs and discuss your implementation needs, then guide accordingly.

      Maintain is simple - keep the lights on.  From patching and updating to responding to service outages, we are full service network operations team.  Might sound contrary to our implementation phase, but technology and tools allow us to be efficient with a small team.

      We want to be an extension of your team.  We dig in and put actual "hands on keyboard" to make the solution work.  Give us a try, you won't be disappointed.
